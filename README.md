The app is done as [Android Basics: User Input](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-user-input--ud836) project. So I made it project programmatically and will introduce You what I have done overall.

This app keeps score points in the game of chess. The screen is divided into two parts, every part consists of:

1. Player name
2. `TextView` that displays the score using methods `displayForPlayer1` and `displayForPlayer2`
3. Three buttons:
  1. `Victory` button which increasing the score for victorious player by 1 point
  2. `Loss` button which leaves score of game unchanged, according to the rules of the game of chess
  3. `Draw` button which button which increasing the score for each player by 0.5 point
4. `Reset` button which resets the score for both players back to 0
